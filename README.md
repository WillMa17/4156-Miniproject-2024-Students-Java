The static bug finder used for this project is pmd. In order to use pmd:

1. Run "mvn package" to download the necessary dependencies.
2. Run "mvn pmd::check".
3. The pmd results will be in IndividualProject/target/pmd.xml.

Furthermore, this project also uses Mockito to implement tests for RouteController. Nothing needs to be done for this.
